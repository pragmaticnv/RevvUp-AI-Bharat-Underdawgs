## 🚀 The Problem
The automotive modification culture in India is exploding, but enthusiasts face three critical barriers:
1.  **Lack of Visualization:** Users depend on 2D images or guesswork, leading to expensive aesthetic mistakes.
2.  **RTO Compliance Anxiety:** With strict Motor Vehicle Acts, owners struggle to verify if modifications (tints, exhausts, kits) are street-legal.
3.  **Trust Deficit:** Finding skilled, verified mechanics for complex installations is difficult and prone to scams.

## 💡 The Solution
**RevvUp** is India's first AI-powered automotive ecosystem that bridges the gap between visualization, procurement, and legal compliance.

We combine **high-fidelity 3D rendering** with **Generative AI** to let users visualize mods on their exact car model, check their legality instantly, and book installation with verified partners.
